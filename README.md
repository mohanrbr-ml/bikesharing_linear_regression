## General Information
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes understand the factors on which the demand for shared bikes depends.  The company wants to know which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes and how well those variables describe the bike demands.  Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors. 

## Conclusions
We have identified four variables - registered, workingday, fall, summer
Based on the values of coefficients,  the maximum impacting variable is 'registered'.
The next is 'workingday' which has negative coefficient implying that on working days the usage of bikes is lesser than non working days.

More users need to be registered to increase the business by offering more incentives for those who register.

On working days use of shared bikes is lesser. To increase the usage on workingdays some new ideas need to be thought and attempted. For example, the bikesharing company can tie up with other businesses and offer incentives for promoting bike usage during workingdays. May be additional pickup and drop points  near other businesses can be added.

The other factors are dependent season. They have low coefficients. Still the business may try some ideas like offering discounts during fall and winter seasons to attract more users. They can provide winter wear at discounted rates when users register.
